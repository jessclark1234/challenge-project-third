# challenge-project-third

## Description

The job for this challenge project was to create a random password generator using JavaScript. This was to show how to use JavaScript to help with the interactability of the webpage and how to use code to create random passwords using special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase characters. 

## Usage

The best usage for this application is as a random password generator for security purposes on personal accounts. 

## Instructions

Simply click the "Generate Password" button on the page. A series of alerts will pop up prompting you to pick special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. It will also ask you how long you'd like your password to be. After that, it will spit out a randomly generated password for your use.
